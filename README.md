# Talent Pool Manager


The key to success in any organization is attracting and retaining top talent.
Talent pool manager (TPM) portal organizes the talent info of employees within the company. This portal can be leveraged by project leads, sales leads, HR and other associates of the company. 

TPM will enable project & sales lead to evaluate the existing talent, pricing, availability etc… within the company and deploy or plan the projects or sales accordingly. It will also give an overview of inhouse talent, their review/feedback to HR and other department heads.


For this project we will use employee data from IBM Watson analytics: https://www.ibm.com/communities/analytics/watson-analytics-blog/hr-employee-attrition/
